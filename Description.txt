Just to share some clarification. In certain cases we can't help but to tag a tweet as having a keyword that is listed in our signal keywords dataset. But we can also assess if that same user has used any other signal keywords previously. Ultimately, a specialist is going to get alerted to a tweet that has a high negative sentiment (found based on geo-location) but the specialist will be responsible on whether they wish to flag that account for further observation and continue to track that handle's tweets. At this point, it's not profiling because it's only based on that tweet and a majority of the time a specialist won't be able to determine the race or gender of a person based on only the twitter handle (although the specialist can be biased due to assumptions but this is a different subject altogether).
